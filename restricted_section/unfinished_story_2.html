        <p>Welcome to the second unfinished story. To go back, you can click the links on top anytime.</p>
        <p>One day, Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas wanted a sidekick.</p>
      <p>“Let’s make a robot sidekick!” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
      <p>“Ok!” said Super Chicky.</p>
      <p>Then, they went to program their robot. It operated on a remote control, it had flamethrowers, an engine the size of 5 tables, and could lift a ton.</p>
      <p>2 hours later…</p>
      <p>They finished their robot. “Let’s test it out!” said Super Chicky. “We need to make sure it works!”</p>
      <p>They told their robot to go forwards. It went backwards. “Yaa!” said Super Chicky.</p>
      <p>“Wait.” said Super Bob Bananas. “If we tell it to go backwards, it will go forward!”</p>
      <p>“Good idea!” said Super Chicky. Then he told his robot to go backward. It actually went backward. Then he flew out of the house and went to destroy a building. “Poopy. We just created a new villain.”</p>
      <p>“We need to make a new robot to destroy the old one.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
      <p>“Good point.” said Super Chicky. “But who will make it?”</p>
      <p>“Um, I think I need to hire a guy who likes robots.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
      <p>“Like George?” said Super Chicky.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, like George.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
      <p>“Let’s make signs that say ‘Robot needed for destroying other robot! We’ll pay you to do it!’” said Super Chicky.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, on the planet Bob:</p>
      <p>Poopypants, another superhero, was watching Earth for signs of life. He saw Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas, but he said “Oh. No life there.” Then, he saw the sign, so he teleported to Earth. “Ooh! A sign!” said Poopypants. “But no life.” said Poopypants. “Well, let’s destroy this planet!”</p>
      <p>“Wait, wut?” said Super Chicky. Then Super Chicky grabbed Super Bob Bananas and they both flew out into the sky just as Poopypants exploded into a massive ball of energy, and destroyed the planet.</p>
