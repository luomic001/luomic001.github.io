    <p>Welcome to the first unfinished story. To go back, you can click the links on top anytime.</p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a kid named George. He loved to pretend he was a superhero. He asked himself: “Can I really be a superhero when I grow up?” He tried. He made jetpacks so that he could fly, boxing gloves for super-strength, and wings so that he could land. But then, he got bored of being a superhero. So he became… a villain! He robbed banks, built evil machines, and destroyed buildings. Somebody had to stop him!</p>
    <p>Super Chicky was reading the newspaper. “Evil machines rob banks and destroy buildings!” Super Chicky said: “Bawk Bawk bock Bock bawk!” Then he went to destroy George. He called up Super Bob Bananas to help.</p>
    <p>Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas had to know the location of George’s base. Super Chicky said: “Bock bawk cluck Bawk bock Cluck bock bock cluck!” which means “Using the location of the attacks, we can determine the rough location of George’s base!” which translates to “George’s base is near the attack sites!” So then they pinpointed the location of George’s base, then they flew there.</p>
    <p>George watched from his fortress. He made all his archers attack. Super Bob Bananas and Super Chicky dodged all of them. But then, George shot 500 arrows that followed Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas. Super Chicky made a ball of lightning that destroyed all the arrows. To protect himself, George made a ball of lava, but it was too late. His palace was cut in half.    </p>
    <p>“No!” cried George. “I will destroy all of you!” He summoned robots to get them. Super Chicky couldn’t summon another ball of lightning, so Super Bob Bananas threw bananas at them. It had no effect. Super Bob Bananas and Super Chicky were put in front of George, their hands tied together. George took out a gun. Just as George was about to shoot, Super Bob Bananas said: “You’re holding the gun backwards!” Then, he summoned a knife, cut the ropes, and shot bananas at a weak pillar in his weakened palace. A boulder came down and flattened him. With this, Super Chicky found new energy. He summoned another ball of energy, destroying all the robots.</p>
    <p>“Yay!” Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas said. Then George came out from under the pile. He exploded, and Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas were sent far, far away.</p>
    <p>“Where are we?” asked Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>Super Chicky glanced at their surroundings. “I have no idea. Maybe we are not on Earth anymore.”</p>
    <p>“Um, the soil is red, so it might be Mars.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>“Well, where else will we be? The sun looks the same, only smaller. So that means we’re farther from the sun. And we can fly more easily, because there is less gravitational pull. We’re on Mars.” said Super Chicky.</p>
    <p>“Let’s get back to Earth.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
