    <p>Welcome to the first unfinished story. To go back, you can click the links on top anytime.</p>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a kid named George. He loved to pretend he was a superhero. He asked himself: “Can I really be a superhero when I grow up?” He tried. He made jetpacks so that he could fly, boxing gloves for super-strength, and wings so that he could land. But then, he got bored of being a superhero. So he became… a villain! He robbed banks, built evil machines, and destroyed buildings. Somebody had to stop him!</p>
    <p>Super Chicky was reading the newspaper. “Evil machines rob banks and destroy buildings!” Super Chicky said: “Bawk Bawk bock Bock bawk!” Then he went to destroy George. He called up Super Bob Bananas to help.</p>
    <p>Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas had to know the location of George’s base. Super Chicky said: “Bock bawk cluck Bawk bock Cluck bock bock cluck!” which means “Using the location of the attacks, we can determine the rough location of George’s base!” which translates to “George’s base is near the attack sites!” So then they pinpointed the location of George’s base, then they flew there.</p>
    <p>George watched from his fortress. He made all his archers attack. Super Bob Bananas and Super Chicky dodged all of them. But then, George shot 500 arrows that <i>followed</i> Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas. Super Chicky made a ball of lightning that destroyed all the arrows. To protect himself, George made a ball of lava, but it was too late. His palace was cut in half.    </p>
    <p>“No!” cried George. “I will destroy all of you!” He summoned robots to get them. Super Chicky couldn’t summon another ball of lightning, so Super Bob Bananas threw bananas at them. It had no effect. Super Bob Bananas and Super Chicky were put in front of George, their hands tied together. George took out a gun. Just as George was about to shoot, Super Bob Bananas said: “You’re holding the gun backwards!” Then, he summoned a knife, cut the ropes, and shot bananas at a weak pillar in his weakened palace. A boulder came down and flattened him. With this, Super Chicky found new energy. He summoned another ball of energy, destroying all the robots.</p>
    <p>“Yay!” Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas said. Then George came out from under the pile. He exploded, and Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas were sent far, far away.</p>
    <p>“Where are we?” asked Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>Super Chicky glanced at their surroundings. “I have no idea. Maybe we are not on Earth anymore.”</p>
    <p>“Um, the soil is red, so it might be Mars.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>“Well, where else will we be? The sun looks the same, only smaller. So that means we’re farther from the sun. And we can fly more easily, because there is less gravitational pull. We’re on Mars.” said Super Chicky.</p>
    <p>“Let’s get back to Earth.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>So they flew, and flew, and flew some more until they got back to Earth.</p>
    <p>“Yay! We’re back!” said Super Chicky. “We shall revenge!”</p>
    <p>Then they landed in a tiny island in the middle of the ocean.</p>
    <p>“Well, my GPS can help! It always points me in the right direction!” said Super Chicky.</p>
    <p>“Please turn right.” said the GPS.</p>
    <p>Super Chicky turned right. Then, he crashed into a tree. “Ow!” he exclaimed.</p>
    <p>“Maybe we can use my GPS.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>Then they flew back to Super Chicky’s base to get some food. Then, they crafted an anti-teleportation machine. They also built a giant robot to zap all of George’s robots with lasers.</p>
    <p>Later, at George’s base...  Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas sneaked up on George’s newly built base. It had sensors, automatic archers, robot short-circuters, and landmines. First, Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas dug under to deactivate all the land mines, then they short circuited the robot short-circuters. Because the land mines were not working, an alarm sounded. George came, but he didn’t see anything (because they were underground), so he ignored it. Then, he looked through his x-ray security camera and he saw them.</p>
    <p>“And the battle begins.” muttered George. “Robots, attack!” Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas used the laser beams to vaporize the robots. Then, they used the laser to bring down George’s base (again). “Aw, come on!” said George. Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas aimed the laser beam straight at George. He jumped up, but he had to fall down. He got cut in half by the laser.</p>
    <p>“Yay!” said Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>“Hahaha! Nice try. Get trolled!” said George.</p>
    <p>“Wut?” said Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>“That was just a robot you were fighting against. This is the real me. LEL!”</p>
    <p>“Ok, this guy is starting to annoy me.” said Super Chicky.</p>
    <p>“Let’s destroy him.” said Super Bob Bananas.</p>
    <p>They aimed a laser straight at his chest. But then George made a red laser-ball. It quickly expanded, and it hit Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas, destroyed their robot, and sent them flying through the skies.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the single laser from Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas had penetrated George’s armor, and hit him. “Ow.” he said.</p>
    <p>Also meanwhile, in a hospital, a doctor told his nurse “I have nothing to do these days. All the work is just sit here and get paid. It’s so boring.” Then Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas crashed through the ceiling and crashed into the two beds in the room. “Ooh! Something I can do!” said the doctor.</p>
    <p>The doctor fixed up Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas, and they planned another attack on George’s base. They planted a bomb under his base to clear the walls. Then, they blew everything else up, and sneaked around the base and made scarecrows.</p>
    <p>“Ooh!” said George. “Let’s destroy them!” Then George sent his army to attack the scarecrows. Then, when George was sitting on his throne, Super Chicky and Super Bob Bananas came and killed him.</p>
    <p>Then they went back home and ate cake and slept. “Narf.” said Super Chicky. They read the newspaper. “George is dead! New villain destroys building!” </p>
    <p>“Wut” said Super Chicky.</p>
